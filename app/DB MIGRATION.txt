Each time the database models change, repeat the migrate and upgrade commands.

$ flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
The migration script needs to be reviewed and edited, as Alembic is not always able to detect every change you make to your models. In particular, Alembic is currently unable to detect table name changes, column name changes, or anonymously named constraints. A detailed summary of limitations can be found in the Alembic autogenerate documentation. Once finalized, the migration script also needs to be added to version control.

Then you can apply the changes described by the migration script to your database:

$ flask db upgrade

To sync the database in another system just refresh the migrations folder from source control and run the upgrade command.

To see all the commands that are available run this command:

$ flask db --help





flask db migrate

flask db upgrade
